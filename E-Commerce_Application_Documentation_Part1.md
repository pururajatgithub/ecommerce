### Module Integration Architecture

The modules are integrated through Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture:

1. **Model Layer**: Data models define structure and relationships
2. **View Layer**: Views handle business logic and user interactions
3. **Template Layer**: Templates provide user interface and presentation
4. **URL Configuration**: Routes connect URLs to appropriate views
5. **Middleware**: Custom middleware provides cross-cutting concerns

This modular approach ensures:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has distinct responsibilities
- **Maintainability**: Code organization facilitates easy updates
- **Scalability**: New features can be added as additional modules
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested independently
- **Reusability**: Modules can be adapted for other projects

The E-Shop application demonstrates how these modules work together to create a cohesive, functional e-commerce platform that serves both educational and practical purposes.
